This is a reduced source version of the Purde University oSCJ project,
modified for use with the Fiji VM.

The oSCJ project web page can be found at:

    http://sss.cs.purdue.edu/projects/oscj/

The unmodified oSCJ source is available via Mercurial from:

    https://scj-jsr302.googlecode.com/hg/

This code base is branched from the oSCJ version 2.0 release.  The
modifications of the upstream source in this project are:

 * Unnecessary components have been removed to reduce the repository
   size and scope
 * Some interfaces may have been changed to reflect the evolution of
   the relationship between oSCJ and the Fiji VM
 * Bug fixes

The original oSCJ license terms apply to this work.
