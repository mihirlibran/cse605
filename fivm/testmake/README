Testmake
Copyright (C) 2010 Fiji Systems Inc.

Testmake makes writing tests for command-line programs easy, by allowing 
you to use familiar 'make' syntax to create tests. Additional syntax is 
provided for asserting the return code and expected output patterns. 
Additionally, a Ruby API is provided for scripting tests.

Currently testmake requires a POSIX-like system. An autoconf-based 
installer is provided. The code is BSD licensed, and we encourage users 
to redistribute and/or modify the software even in commercial settings.

FIXME: add more documentation!
